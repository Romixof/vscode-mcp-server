## [0.9.0]

### Added

- Security tools (3): `find_secrets_code` (AWS/GitHub/Slack/Google/Stripe keys, private key blocks, JWTs and generic credential assignments — values masked, placeholders ignored), `security_scan_code` (risky constructs: eval, innerHTML sinks, shell-injection exec, disabled TLS verification, unsafe yaml/pickle/subprocess, SQL string concatenation), `check_dependencies_vulnerabilities_code` (npm audit with per-package advisories and patched versions).
- Performance tools (3): `analyze_bundle_code` (build output sizes with largest files and their share), `get_performance_report_code` (server uptime/memory, workspace weight, heaviest npm packages), `profile_command_code` (wall-clock timing of shell commands over repeated runs).
- New `vscode-mcp-server.enabledTools.security` and `enabledTools.performance` settings, enabled by default.

## [0.8.0]

### Added

- AI productivity tools (4): `find_dead_code_code` (exported symbols never referenced elsewhere), `snapshot_workspace_code` (SHA-256 snapshots with before/after compare), `regex_tester_code` (pattern testing with groups and replace preview), `convert_encoding_code` (utf-8 / utf-8-bom / utf-16le / latin1 detect and convert).
- New `vscode-mcp-server.enabledTools.productivity` setting, enabled by default.
- Branding: new extension logo, publisher and repository now point at Romixo's GitHub, display name "VSCodium MCP Server".

## [0.7.0] - 2026-08-22

### Added

- Persistent memory tools (4): `memory_load_code`, `memory_save_code`, `memory_search_code`, `memory_clear_code` — global memory in `~/Mammouth/MEMORY.md`, per-project memory as `{workspaceName}_MEMORY.md` in the workspace root, with dated entries organized under markdown sections.
- Testing tools (5): `run_tests_code` (auto-detects vitest/jest/pytest/mocha/playwright/cypress), `get_test_coverage_code` (coverage reports for vitest/jest/pytest), `format_document_code` (prettier/black/ruff/rustfmt/gofmt with check-only mode), `lint_and_fix_code` (eslint/ruff/flake8/pylint auto-fix), `get_git_diff_code` (staged/unstaged diffs).
- Git workflow tools (5): `commit_changes_code` (auto-generated conventional commit messages), `create_branch_code` (create/switch/list branches), `get_blame_code` (line-by-line authorship), `list_conflicts_code` (merge conflict markers), `stash_changes_code` (push/pop/list/drop/apply/show).
- Documentation tools (5): `get_package_dependencies_code` (npm/pip/cargo/go/composer/bundler), `get_file_history_code` (per-file git history with stats), `generate_docstring_code` (JSDoc/docstring/PHPDoc/GoDoc/Rustdoc generation), `get_project_context_code` (stack, structure, entry points, scripts, test setup), `find_todo_code` (TODO/FIXME scanning with severity classification).
- Developer productivity / database tools (5): `run_sql_query_code`, `test_api_endpoint_code`, `check_env_vars_code`, `get_open_ports_code`, `restart_dev_server_code`.
- New `vscode-mcp-server.enabledTools` settings for each tool group (`memory`, `test`, `git`, `documentation`, `database`), all enabled by default. The server restarts automatically when the configuration changes.

### Changed

- Total tool count grows from 5 to 29.
- TypeScript source recovered for the tool groups that previously only shipped as compiled JavaScript.

### Fixed

- Server stability on Windows: concurrent MCP requests no longer corrupt the shared stateless transport (requests are now serialized server-side), which was causing `MCP error -32000: Connection closed` / `Not connected` after a long-running command.
- `GET`/`DELETE /mcp` now answer with a spec-compliant bare `405` (+ `Allow: POST`) instead of a JSON-RPC error body that clients misread as a dropped connection.
- Shell execution is PowerShell-compatible: the working-directory prefix no longer uses bash-only `&&`, commands run through VS Code shell integration with per-terminal serialization, timeouts are enforced correctly, and the real exit code is captured via an end-of-output marker instead of always reporting success.
- On Windows the extension terminal now prefers Git Bash when installed, so bash syntax (`&&`, heredocs, forward-slash paths) works out of the box; PowerShell fallback stays fully supported.
- Git tools: exit codes are detected properly (failed commands are no longer reported as success), commit/stash messages and branch sources are safely quoted, empty branch-name slugs are rejected, blame line numbers parse from the correct field, and merge-conflict detection runs `git diff --name-only --diff-filter=U` first so clean merges report "no conflicts".
- Memory tools: clearing one entry keeps its section, clearing a whole section removes only that section, and search results attribute matches to the right scope/section.
- Database tools: environment-variable scan uses glob excludes (no regex crash), MySQL connection strings parse into proper host/port/user flags, PostgreSQL JSON output wraps arbitrary queries safely, port listing filters established connections, and every tool falls back cleanly when no terminal is available.
- Test tools: pytest detection no longer depends on requirements.txt being readable, formatter/linter detection checks the file extension before probing configs, test patterns are always quoted, coverage flags match each framework (c8 for mocha, `--coverage.include` for vitest, `--collectCoverageFrom` for jest), and formatting excerpts are capped at 100 lines.
- Documentation tools: `find_todo_code` no longer silently skips every file (a global-regex capture-group bug) and honors include/exclude globs correctly; cargo/poetry/Pipfile section parsing no longer truncates at inline arrays like `features = ["derive"]`; dependency ecosystem filters map npm/pypi/cargo aliases to their data keys; docstring replacement handles single-line existing docstrings.

## [0.4.0]
